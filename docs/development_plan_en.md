# üéØ Mockau Development Plan

## üèÅ Milestone 1: Core Functionality and MVP (Core Mocking Engine)

**Goal:** Create a Minimum Viable Product that demonstrates the basic capabilities of mocking, storage, and Z3 usage.

**Key Tasks:**

* **Request Reception and Redirection Module:**
    * Basic setup of an HTTP/S server to receive requests.
    * Ability to proxy requests to real services (if a mock is not found).
* **Integration with MongoDB for Storing Mocks:**
    * Define a schema for storing mocking rules (expectations, actions, predicates).
    * CRUD operations for managing mocks via API or CLI.
* **Integration with Elasticsearch for Requests/Events:**
    * Basic schema for storing information about incoming requests and responses (or mocking events).
    * Sending data to Elasticsearch for each request.
* **Basic Implementation of Predicates with Z3:**
    * Create a simple DSL (or API) for defining predicates (e.g., equality of headers, request parameters, body parts).
    * Use Z3 for matching requests with mock predicates.
    * Simplest actions: return a static response (code, headers, body).
* **Core Documentation:**
    * Installation and basic usage instructions.
    * Description of the storage format for mocks and events.
* **Testing:**
    * Unit tests for key components.
    * Simple integration tests for the "request -> mock -> response" scenario.

## üöÄ Milestone 2: Enhanced Predicate Logic and Analysis with Z3

**Goal:** Deepen Z3 integration, provide more complex predicates, and implement basic analytical capabilities.

**Key Tasks:**

* **Extended DSL/API for Predicates:**
    * Support for more complex conditions: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, comparisons (numerical, string), regular expressions.
    * Predicates for various parts of the request (path, method, query parameters, headers, JSON/XML/form body).
* **Predicate Analysis with Z3:**
    * **Overlap Detection:** Identification of rules that can handle the same requests, potentially leading to ambiguity.
    * **Dead Rule Detection:** Identification of rules whose conditions can never be met due to conflicts with other higher-priority rules or internal contradictions.
    * **Redundant Predicate Detection:** Simplification of predicates if Z3 can prove their equivalence to simpler forms.
* **Mock Priority Management:**
    * Ability to set priorities for mocking rules.
* **Improved Event Storage in Elasticsearch:**
    * Adding metadata to events: which mock was triggered, Z3 matching result (if applicable).
* **Predicate Debugging Tools:**
    * Ability to "test" a predicate with a sample request and see why it matched or not.
* **Testing:**
    * Tests for complex predicates and their combinations.
    * Tests for Z3 analytical functions.

## ‚ú® Milestone 3: Advanced Mocking Capabilities and Data Handling

**Goal:** Add flexibility in modifying requests/responses and improve data handling.

**Key Tasks:**

* **Dynamic Responses and Modification:**
    * Ability to modify the response body/headers based on data from the request (e.g., via templating engines or scripts).
    * Ability to modify proxied requests/responses.
    * Support for response delays.
    * Sequence responses.
* **Stateful Mocking:**
    * Ability to create mocks that change their behavior based on previous requests (e.g., counters, state changes).
* **Improved Search and Analytics in Elasticsearch:**
    * Creation of an API or interface for searching and filtering requests/events in Elasticsearch.
    * Basic dashboards (if a UI exists) or scripts for data aggregation (e.g., mock trigger frequency, request types).
* **Mock Import/Export:**
    * Functionality for exporting sets of mocks (e.g., in JSON/YAML) and importing them.
* **User Feedback from Z3:**
    * Clearer error or warning messages from Z3 analytical functions.
* **Testing:**
    * Tests for dynamic responses, stateful mocks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Milestone 4: User Experience (DX) Improvement and Integrations

**Goal:** Make the tool convenient for developers and testers, ensure integration with other systems.

**Key Tasks:**

* **Admin UI (Web Interface):**
    * View, create, edit, delete mocks.
    * View requests and events from Elasticsearch.
    * Visualize Z3 analysis results (overlaps, dead rules).
    * Manage Mockau settings.
* **Client Libraries:**
    * Development of client libraries for popular languages (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript) to simplify mock setup and request verification in tests.
* **CI/CD Integration:**
    * Examples and instructions for integrating Mockau into CI/CD pipelines.
    * Ability to reset state or load specific sets of mocks before tests.
* **Extended Documentation and Examples:**
    * Detailed guides, tutorials, usage examples for various scenarios.
    * API documentation.
* **Performance Optimization:**
    * Profiling and optimization of bottlenecks, especially in request matching and Z3 interaction.
* **Security:**
    * Authentication for API and UI (if necessary).
    * Protection against incorrect or malicious predicates/scripts.

## üß† Milestone 5: AI/ML Integration and Predictive Capabilities

**Goal:** Implement advanced AI/ML mechanics based on collected data.

**Key Tasks:**

* **Failrate Analysis:**
    * Automatic analysis of responses (especially proxied or generated ones) to identify if they are becoming more frequently incorrect (e.g., increase in 5xx errors).
    * Alerts for anomalous increases in failrate.
* **Request/Response Schema Analysis:**
    * Automatic detection or validation of data schemas (JSON Schema, OpenAPI) based on traffic.
    * Detection of schema changes (schema drift).
* **Predictive Mock Generation:**
    * Suggestion of mock options based on analysis of frequently used requests and their responses.
    * Automatic generation of mock data (e.g., using Faker-like libraries) based on the identified schema.
* **Traffic Anomaly Detection:**
    * Identification of unusual request patterns that may indicate problems in the tested application or incorrect API usage.
* **Integration with AI/ML Visualization Tools:**
    * Ability to export data or integrate with platforms for deeper analysis and visualization of ML metrics.

### üí° General Recommendations Throughout the Project:

* **Active Testing:** Continuously write unit, integration, and possibly e2e tests.
* **Documentation:** Keep documentation up to date. Every new feature should be documented.
* **Code Quality:** Regular refactoring, adherence to clean code principles.
* **Community Feedback:** As the project grows, actively collect feedback from users (if any) to adjust plans.
* **Versioning:** Use semantic versioning.
* **Containerization:** Provide a Docker image for easy deployment.
